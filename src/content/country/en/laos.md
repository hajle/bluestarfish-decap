Laos is a country slightly less known than its neighbors, but equally fascinating and full of undiscovered treasures. Temples hidden among the mountains and dense forests, quiet towns on the Mekong River and authentic culture make it a place where you can truly experience the spirit of Southeast Asia.

Why is it worth visiting Laos?

## Luang Prabang

Formerly the royal capital, today it is a charming town full of Buddhist temples, French colonial buildings and magnificent waterfalls.

## Mekong River

The vein of the country, along which there are picturesque villages and majestic landscapes.

## Vang Vieng Caves

Impressive rock formations and underground rivers await daredevils ready for underground adventures.

## Si Phan Don beaches

Also known as the "Four Thousand Islands", it is a place where time seems to pass slower and life centers around the river.

## Laotian cuisine

Combining influences from neighboring countries, but maintaining its own unique identity - larb, sticky rice and mak hoong are just some of the local specialties.
